Rostr
======

**1st Place** 'Back to School' Hackathon - August 2015, DBC

**Rostr** is a tool for teachers/organizers to create balanced groups based on skill level. It was developed at a 'Back to School' themed hackathon held by Dev Bootcamp, San Francisco. The idea for Rostr emerged from a problem faced at the hackathon itself, when groups became unbalanced upon formation. We felt organizers would benefit from a group building tool, so we built one. We intend to continue to build Rostr beyond its hackathon version.
